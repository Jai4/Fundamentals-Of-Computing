### WEEK 2 - Rock-Paper-Scissor-Lizard-Spock Game

<p align="left">
Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock (RPSLS) is a variant of Rock-paper-scissors that allows five choices. Each choice wins against two other choices, loses against two other choices and ties against itself. In our first mini-project, we will build a Python function rpsls(name) that takes as input the string name, which is one of "rock", "paper", "scissors", "lizard", or "Spock".The function then simulates playing a round of Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock by generating its own random choice from these alternatives and then determining the winner.

### WEEK 3 - Guess The Number

<p align="left">
One of the simplest two-player games is “Guess the number”. The first player thinks of a secret number in some known range while the second player attempts to guess the number. After each guess, the first player answers either “Higher”, “Lower” or “Correct!” depending on whether the secret number is higher, lower or equal to the guess. In this project, you will build a simple interactive program in Python where the computer will take the role of the first player while you play as the second player.

### Week 4 - Stop Watch

<p align="left">
Our mini-project for this week will focus on combining text drawing in the canvas with timers to build a simple digital stopwatch that keeps track of the time in tenths of a second. The stopwatch should contain "Start", "Stop" and "Reset" buttons.

### Week 5 - Pong

<p align="left">
In this project, we will build a version of Pong, one of the first arcade video games (1972). While Pong is not particularly exciting compared to today's video games, Pong is relatively simple to build and provides a nice opportunity to work on the skills that you will need to build a game like Asteroids.
